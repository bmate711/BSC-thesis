abstract="Today, robotics is an important cornerstone of modern industrial production. Robots are used for numerous reasons including reliability and continuously high quality of work. The main decision factor is the overall efficiency of the robotic system in the production line. One key issue for this is the optimality of the whole set of robotic movements for industrial applications, which typically consist of multiple atomic tasks such as welding seams, drilling holes, etc. Currently, in many industrial scenarios such movements are optimized manually. This is costly and error-prone. Therefore, researchers have been working on algorithms for automatic computation of optimal trajectories for several years. This problem gets even more complicated due to multiple additional factors like redundant kinematics, collision avoidance, possibilities of ambiguous task performance, etc. This survey article summarizes and categorizes the approaches for optimization of the robotic task sequence. It provides an overview of existing combinatorial problems that are applied for robot task sequencing. It also highlights the strengths and the weaknesses of existing approaches as well as the challenges for future research in this domain. The article is meant for both scientists and practitioners. For scientists, it provides an overview on applied algorithmic approaches. For practitioners, it presents existing solutions, which are categorized according to the classes of input and output parameters.",

abstract="Very Large-Scale Neighborhood (VLSN) search is the idea of using neighborhoods of exponential size to find high-quality solutions to complex optimization problems efficiently. However, so far, VLSN algorithms are essentially described and implemented in terms of low-level implementation concepts, preventing code reuse and extensibility which are trademarks of constraint-programming systems. This paper aims at remedying this limitation and proposes a constraint-based VLSN (CBVLSN) framework to describe VLSNs declaratively and compositionally. Its main innovations are the concepts of cycle-consistent MoveGraphs and compositional moves which make it possible to specify an application in terms of constraints and objectives and to derive a dedicated VLSN algorithm automatically. The constraint-based VLSN framework has been prototyped in COMET and its efficiency is shown to be comparable to dedicated implementations.",

abstract="The equality generalized traveling salesman problem (E-GTSP) is an extension of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the set of cities is partitioned into clusters, and the salesman has to visit every cluster exactly once. It is well known that any instance of E-GTSP can be transformed into a standard asymmetric instance of the TSP, and therefore solved with a TSP solver. This paper evaluates the performance of the state-of-the art TSP solver Lin--Kernighan--Helsgaun (LKH) on transformed E-GTSP instances. Although LKH is used without any modifications, the computational evaluation shows that all instances in a well-known library of benchmark instances, GTSPLIB, could be solved to optimality in a reasonable time. In addition, it was possible to solve a series of new very-large-scale instances with up to 17,180 clusters and 85,900 vertices. Optima for these instances are not known but it is conjectured that LKH has been able to find solutions of a very high quality. The program's performance has also been evaluated on a large number of instances generated by transforming arc routing problem instances into E-GTSP instances. The program is free of charge for academic and non-commercial use and can be downloaded in source code.",
